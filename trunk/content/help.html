<p>Expression Search is an extension to Thunderbird (versions 3.0+) which add powerful message searching features.
It's a modified version of GMailUI, written by Ken Mixter.</p>
<p>
Type "hello world" to search within the current view for this string in subject/from/to/cc.<br>
Type "from:fred to:tom attachment:yes" to see all messages from Fred to Tom in the current view that have an attachment.<br>
Press Ctrl+Enter to have this search apply to all folders.<br>
Press Shift+Enter to invoke Gloda Search in all indexed folders.<br>
</p>

<p>Expression Search's features are described below.</p>

<h3>Search expressions and quick search key</h3>
<p>
This extension adds a new search text box to the end of your quick search bar. Whatever phrase you enter
is searched for in your currently selected folder's to/from/cc/subject fields.  Notice that by default
the body is not searched for your search phrase.  If that results in too many matches,you can focus the seach
using "operators".  Operators are just short words followed by a colon, such as "from:amazon.com".
</p>

Here are some examples:

<p>
<b>weekend plans</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 
'weekend plans' in the <i>from</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>cc</i>, or <i>subject</i>
fields.</p>
<p>

<b>from:mike</b> or <b>f:mike</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'mike' in the <i>from</i>
field.</p>
<p>
<b>to:bill</b> or <b>t:bill</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'bill' in the
<i>to</i> or <i>cc</i> fields of the message.
</p>
<p>
<b>subject:electric bill</b> or <b>s:electric bill</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'electric bill' 
in the <i>subject</i> fields of the message.
</p>
<p>
<b>attachment:yes</b> or <b>a:yes</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for an attachment,
Notice that it does not search for attachments named "yes".  You can also use "y" or "1" for 
"yes".  You can use "no", "n", or "0" to search for messages without attachments.
</p>
<p>
<b>is:replied</b> or <b>i:UnRead</b> or <b>status:Forwarded</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for status, The
status can be one of Replied, Read, Marked, Forwarded, UnRead or Attachment.
</p>

<p>
<b>before:2011/03/09 07:12:00</b> or <b>be:09 Mar 2011 05:00:00</b> or <b>after:Mar 10, 2011</b> or <b>af:(2011/03/01 -2011/03/09)</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view within the date range, The
date format can be checked <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse'>Here<a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>body:electric bill</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'electric bill' 
in the body of the message. On large or remote folders it may take some time. Also, if you 
combine this with other search operators like "from:", "subject:" or "to:" this will speed 
things up considerably. 
</p>
<p>
<b>all: weekend plans</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for
'weekend plans' anywhere in the message, including the <i>from</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>cc</i>, or <i>subject</i>
fields, and the <i>body</i>.
</p>
<p>
<b>g: weather</b>
</p>
<p>This will call gloda (faceted) search if gloda enabled. This mode can't be used toghter will other specifications like 'f:' or 't:'.
</p>
<p>
<b>3+2</b>
</p>
<p>If the expression looks like an arithmetic one, when you press enter, it will be calculated and the result will be shown in the search box.
</p>
<h3>Hot Key</h3>
<p>
By default, Press Ctrl+F, your cursor will appear in the quick search bar, and
you will be able to type.
</p>
<p>Once you are typing in your search query, and you hit enter or otherwise let
it begin searching, your cursor will remain inside of the query box to allow you 
to modify the query.  However, if you'd rather go back to browsing your messages,
instead of clicking on the message headers in your search results, you can just
press 'ESC' to refocus back to the message results, and press 'ESC' again to clear
the search criteria.</p>

<h3>Quick Search Virtual Folder</h3>
<p>If you haven't before used 'virtual folders' in Thunderbird, let me introduce them.
This standard feature of Thunderbird lets you create a search, name it, and then
have that name appear in your folders list.  You can select that folder from the
list and see the current result of the saved search.  Note two useful things: 1)
the 'contents' of the virtual folder can actually be in any of your real folders,
and so a virtual folder actually can 'contain' messages that span many folders,
and 2) the virtual folder's contents are recomputed each time you view it, so if
you saved a virtual folder with 'sender' field containing 'Donald', then if you
receive a new message from someone named Donald, it will be placed in your INBOX,
but you'll immediately be able to switch to your Donald virtual folder, and find
it there.</p>
<p>So that's what regular virtual search folders do in Thunderbird. But this
extension makes it extremely easy to create them.  Now, when you normally hit
'enter' in the Expression search quick search bar, you can instead hit
'ctrl-enter' and a virtual folder called 'ExressionSearch' will be created (or modified
if it already existed) to search for that search across ALL of your folders in the
current account.</p>
<p>The resulting virtual folder 'ExpressionSearch' can then be modified
by editing properties, or can be renamed to make it a permanent virtual search folder.
If you do not rename the folder, the next time you use ctrl-enter the ExpressionSearch 
virtual folder is reused to show your new quick search result.</p>

<p>The option "Keep selected folders for saved search" to have the "ExpressionSearch"
virtual folder being persistent not only allows you to mark it as "Preferred" without
the setting being lost when restarting TB, but also you can edit the properties of the
"ExpressionSearch" virtual folder to specify once for all which of your physical folders
should be searched or not with a global non-faceted search (CTRL+Enter).</p>

<h3>More complex searching</h3>
<p>The quick search bar allows you use the simple expressions from above, but it also
allows you to compose more complex searches.  For instance, if you want to search for
a message from Bob Barker to Dave Letterman about monologues, you can use:

</p>
<p><b>f:Bob Barker t:Dave Letterman s:monologues</b>
</p>
<p>If you are tired of getting results that have jokes about "Monica", you can instead use:

</p>
<p><b>f:Bob Barker t:Dave Letterman s:monologues -Monica</b>
</p>
<p>If you are interested in messages from either of these celebrities:

</p>
<p><b>f:Bob Barker or f:Dave Letterman</b>
</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Note 1: For the average user, the above information is usually adequate.  If you
are curious, this feature still relies upon an underlying Thunderbird message searching
mechanism.  That mechanism cannot always perform searches correctly that have a combination of boolean
operators.  So, if you try to perform a search that mixes "ands" and "ors" you may get back
too many results.  As an example, if you were to search for "t:dan and f:(bob or dave)" you
will be mixing boolean operators and the results may be over inclusive or may work.  As an extra technical
note, if you did "t:dan and -f:(bob or dave)", DeMorgan's theorem takes place and you are actually
composing a search of "t:dan and f:-bob and f:-dave".
</p>
<p>
However, due to restrictions in Thunderbird's virtual search folder, the complex searching results maybe correct
in your current search results, but maybe NOT in you search folder. as the search folder can only handle 'Match all'
and 'Match any' types.
</p>
<p>
Note 2: In case you also using the normal search filter, the final results is logically "AND", that means
both filter are effective.
