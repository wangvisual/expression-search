<p>Expression Search is an extension to Thunderbird (versions 3.0+) which add powerful message searching features.
It's a modified version of GMailUI, written by Ken Mixter.</p>
<p>
Type "hello world" to search within the current view for this string in subject/from/to/cc.<br>
Type "from:fred to:tom attachment:yes" to see all messages from Fred to Tom in the current view that have an attachment.<br>
Press Ctrl+Enter to have this search apply to all folders.<br>
Press Shift+Enter to invoke Gloda Search in all indexed folders.<br>
Use Ctrl/Shift+Right Click to search the clicked subject/From/Recipient.<br>
</p>

<p>Expression Search's features are described below.</p>

<h3>Search expressions and quick search key</h3>
<p>
This extension adds a new search text box to the end of your quick search bar. Whatever phrase you enter
is searched for in your currently selected folder's to/from/cc/subject fields.  Notice that by default
the body is not searched for your search phrase.  If that results in too many matches,you can focus the seach
using "operators".  Operators are just short words followed by a colon, such as "from:amazon.com".
</p>

Here are some examples:
<ol><li>
<p><b>weekend plans</b></p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 
'weekend plans' in the <i>from</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>cc</i>, or <i>subject</i>
fields.</p>
<p>If "Act as normal filter" enabled, the "Sender", "Recipients", "Subject" and "Body" buttons will
determine to search in which fields.
</p></li><li><p>

<b>from:mike</b> or <b>f:mike</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'mike' in the <i>from</i>
field.
</p></li><li><p>

<b>to:bill</b> or <b>t:bill</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'bill' in the
<i>to</i> or <i>cc</i> fields of the message.
</p></li><li><p>

<b>subject:electric bill</b> or <b>s:electric bill</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'electric bill' 
in the <i>subject</i> fields of the message. Case insensitive.
</p></li><li><p>

<b>simple:this subject contains special characters like ( ) ' " - etc</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view in the <i>subject</i>
fields of the message. And the pattern can contain special characters. unlike "subject" search, this search won't suffer from <a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124641'>Bug 124641</a>.
</p><p>This pattern must be the last pattern. Case <b>sensitive</b>.
</p></li><li><p>

</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view with <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions'>Regular Expressions</a>
in the <i>subject</i> fields of the message.

</p></li><li><p>

<b>attachment:yes</b> or <b>a:yes</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for an attachment,

</p></li><li><p>

<b>body:electric bill</b>
</p>
<p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'electric bill' 
in the body of the message. On large or remote folders it may take some time. Also, if you

things up considerably.

</p>
<p>If the expression looks like an arithmetic one, when you press enter, it will be calculated and the result will be shown in the search box.
</p></li></ol>

<h3>Hot Key</h3>
<p>
By default, Press Ctrl+F, your cursor will appear in the expression search bar or in the "search in message" bar, depend on where current focus is, and
you will be able to type. See <a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=564328'>Bug 564328</a>.</p>
<p>Expression Search add one additional hot key "Ctrl+B", this will only focus your cursor in the expression search bar.
</p>
<p>Once you are typing in your search query, and you hit enter or otherwise let
it begin searching, your cursor will remain inside of the query box to allow you 
to modify the query.  However, if you'd rather go back to browsing your messages,
instead of clicking on the message headers in your search results, you can just
press 'ESC' to to clear the search criteria, and press 'ESC' again to refocus back</p>

<h3>Quick Search Virtual Folder</h3>
<p>If you haven't before used 'virtual folders' in Thunderbird, let me introduce them.
This standard feature of Thunderbird lets you create a search, name it, and then
have that name appear in your folders list.  You can select that folder from the
list and see the current result of the saved search.  Note two useful things: 1)
the 'contents' of the virtual folder can actually be in any of your real folders,
and so a virtual folder actually can 'contain' messages that span many folders,
and 2) the virtual folder's contents are recomputed each time you view it, so if
you saved a virtual folder with 'sender' field containing 'Donald', then if you
receive a new message from someone named Donald, it will be placed in your INBOX,
but you'll immediately be able to switch to your Donald virtual folder, and find
it there.</p>
<p>So that's what regular virtual search folders do in Thunderbird. But this
extension makes it extremely easy to create them.  Now, when you normally hit
'enter' in the Expression search quick search bar, you can instead hit
'ctrl-enter' and a virtual folder called 'ExressionSearch' will be created (or modified
if it already existed) to search for that search across ALL of your folders in the
current account.</p>
<p>The resulting virtual folder 'ExpressionSearch' can then be modified
by editing properties, or can be renamed to make it a permanent virtual search folder.
If you do not rename the folder, the next time you use ctrl-enter the ExpressionSearch 
virtual folder is reused to show your new quick search result.</p>

<a name='keep_saved_search'/>
<p>The option "<b>Keep selected folders for saved search</b>" to have the "ExpressionSearch"
virtual folder being persistent not only allows you to mark it as "Preferred" without
the setting being lost when restarting TB, but also you can edit the properties of the
"ExpressionSearch" virtual folder to specify once for all which of your physical folders
should be searched or not with a global non-faceted search (CTRL+Enter).</p>

<h3>More complex searching</h3>
<p>The quick search bar allows you use the simple expressions from above, but it also
allows you to compose more complex searches.  For instance, if you want to search for
a message from Bob Barker to Dave Letterman about monologues, you can use:

</p>
<p><b>f:Bob Barker t:Dave Letterman s:monologues</b>
</p>
<p>If you are tired of getting results that have jokes about "Monica", you can instead use:

</p>
<p><b>f:Bob Barker t:Dave Letterman s:monologues -Monica</b>
</p>
<p>If you are interested in messages from either of these celebrities:

</p>
<p><b>f:Bob Barker or f:Dave Letterman</b>
</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Note 1: For the average user, the above information is usually adequate.  If you
are curious, this feature still relies upon an underlying Thunderbird message searching
mechanism.  That mechanism cannot always perform searches correctly that have a combination of boolean
operators.  So, if you try to perform a search that mixes "ands" and "ors" you may get back
too many results.  As an example, if you were to search for "t:dan and f:(bob or dave)" you
will be mixing boolean operators and the results may be over inclusive or may work.  As an extra technical
note, if you did "t:dan and -f:(bob or dave)", DeMorgan's theorem takes place and you are actually
composing a search of "t:dan and f:-bob and f:-dave".
</p>
<p>
However, due to restrictions in Thunderbird's virtual search folder, the complex searching results maybe correct
in your current search results, but maybe NOT in you search folder. as the search folder can only handle 'Match all'
and 'Match any' types.
</p>
<p>
Note 2: In case you also using the normal search filter, the final results is logically "AND", that means
both filter are effective.
</p>

<h3>Click 2 Search</h3>
<p>
If Enabled, you can use Ctrl/Shift+Right Click on sender/receipient/subject column to search for the same sender,
receipient or subject.
</p>
<p>
<a name="c2s_Replace"></a>
For subject line, if provided regular expression match/replace patterns, the pattern will be first executed
<pre>Replace subject before search.
Multiple matches are ORed. Example:
    Match:   \[#(\d*)\]
    Replace: $1
    Subject: [#1212][#2323]Some text
    Result:  (1212 or 2323)</pre>
</p>
<p>
Also common prefix like 'Re:', 'Fw:', [mail-list-name] will be removed before search.

<p>Compared with original GMailUI 0.6, these features are still missing:
<ul>
<li>Use 'Y' to archive selected mail to archive folder (use 'a')</li>
<li>Use J/K to move messages up and down, and Ctrl+J to mark a message as junk (conflict with builtin key mapping, use 'f/b' instead)</li>
<li>Key '/' focuses on the quick search bar (use Ctrl+F)</li>
